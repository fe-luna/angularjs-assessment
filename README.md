## Description

To be honest, I never use AnguarJS and Semantic UI before this assessment ðŸ˜‚

I tried my best to build the project in a elegant way, but there are still some problems like:

1. Some of the styles can be accomplished by Semantic UI, but in a short time I can not use it skillfully, so I tried other ways.
2. Lacking a proper understanding of best practices in AngularJS.
